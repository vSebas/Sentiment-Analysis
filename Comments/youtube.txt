Saturday cartoons when I was a kid, now Saturday rocket launches.
I love that everyone spacex has doing this cast is an actual engineer, not a media person that doesn’t have a clue what they’re talking about.
I imagine one day will be like: Dear passengers, welcome to star express, please fasten your seat belts,  next station Mars. ETA 07:00 PM . Thank you for flying with SpaceX.
Government: how many launches you will do
Elon Musk: yes
Before : "R O C K E T L A U N C H I N G"
World's rarest thing 
Now: it's happening on 
 every weekend 
You're actually flying more often than most airlines atm.
*Calling for landing burn
Me: they're gonna lose signal
*First stage landed without live cutoff
Me: WHAT?!?!
Love hearing Jessicas exited voice when the booster successfully lands and the sattelites are deployed 
Finally the camera did not lost signal on the landing of the stage1 !!! 
Woke twitter celebritard: America was never great
Musk: Falcon 9 go brrrrr
